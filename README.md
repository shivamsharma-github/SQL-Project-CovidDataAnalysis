# SQL-Project-CovidDataAnalysis

In this project, I have downloaded Covid Data from official covid website. So this is real-time data till 2023

Steps:
- Selected the required data from tables
- Looked at Total Cases Vs Total Deaths In India
- Reviwed Total Cases Vs Population In India
- Highlighted countries with highest infection rate compared to population
- Highlighted at countries with highest death count per population
- Looked at death count per Continent

- Global numbers
- Looked at total new cases Vs total deaths with updated death rate
- Looked at Total Population Vs Total Vaccinations Using CTE
- Created a temp table
- Created views to store data for visualizations
